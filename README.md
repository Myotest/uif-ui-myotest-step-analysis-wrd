UIFramework for the ‘Step Analysis’ display screen on the Wearable Reference Design, powered by Myotest’s Step Analysis library demonstrator.

Myotest’s Step Analysis library is, amongst other things, able to reliably count steps and automatically differentiate between walking and running.

Two daily step counts are presented on this screen:

- **Walking steps**: The total number of walking steps recorded since midnight
- **Running steps**: The total number of running steps recorded since midnight

Both counters are automatically reset to zero at midnight.
